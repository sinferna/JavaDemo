one roll = lp - (20*(player weapon strength*random number between 0.05-0.1)) + (5*(enemy player defence*random number between 0.05-0.1))

"You do x damage and receive y damage! z lifepoints left."

when lp == 0 - the Evil Imp dies! It leaves behind 100 coins and a Potion of Vigour. You pick them up.
